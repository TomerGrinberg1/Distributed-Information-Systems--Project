coloring a graph by sending messeages
n this exercise, implement in Java a graph and find a valid coloring for it with 1 + Δ colors,
where Δ is the maximum degree in the graph. At the beginning of the execution, each node holds several properties, 
including its list of neighbors and the ports through which they communicate.
During the program's execution, each node in the graph communicates with its neighbors and updates its color accordingly.
By the end of the program's execution, the graph should be colored in a valid manner using Δ + 1 colors.
